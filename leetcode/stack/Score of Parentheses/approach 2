eg: ((.)(()))-->((.)____)

"depth" of '.' is 2.

As we iterate over the string, when we encounter an opening parentheses our "depth" increases and as we encounter closed parentheses our "depth" decreases
"()" is called a core. This is the only structure that provides us value i.e. 1. Outer parentheses are just increasing the value of our core.

('()'('()'))---> it contains 2 cores.

score of (()(()))=('()')+(('()'))

class Solution {
public:
    int scoreOfParentheses(string S) {
        int depth=0; //this gives us a number of set of outer parentheses our core is surrounded by.
        int score=0;
        for(int i=0;i<S.size();i++){
            if(S[i]=='(')
                depth++;
            else{
                depth--;
                if(S[i-1]=='(')
                    score+=1<<depth;// value of the core added by outer parenthesis
            }
        }
        return score;
    }
};
